# 02. Ubiquituous Languange and Bounded Context

Ubiquituous: being everywhere

    DDD is primarily about modelling an ubiquituous language in an explicitly bounded context.
    Vaughn Vernon/ Domain-Driven Design Distilled

1. Learn That ubiquituous language from experts:
    - Context Dependent.
    - Valid within **limits of applicability**(Bounded).
    - Used by a **community** of problem domain solvers/experts.
    - Shared meaning.
    - **Single** meaning.
    - Problem Domain is closed to the solution domain.
    - **Expressed** in the software model.
    - **Reduces distance** between problem and solution.
  - A change in the language provokes changes in the model.

2. **Conversations** with domain experts, and, between developers.
3. **Identifying** `Entities, Values, Events, Processes, and Contexts`.
4. **Naming** in code, databases, and tests of all types: create classes and objects based on domains, and bounded context.
